All non-technical and underrepresented people have unique stories to tell that can benefit the entire community \u2014 regardless your background.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start by talking about easy ways anyone can get experience speaking. (Spoiler: you don\u2019t have to present alone). We\u2019ll brainstorm new topic ideas anyone can use and learn how to submit a session that will get noticed. From there, we\u2019ll learn storytelling techniques to stay on track and calm your nerves when presenting.\r\n\r\nPresenting is my full-time job and I still have self-doubt and nervousness. I\u2019ll share my story and talk about how I quiet my doubts and pump myself up to speak in front of a large crowd. I'll also discuss my techniques for mentoring and encouraging others to speak for the first time and highlight <a href=\"https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/\">Global Diversity Call For Papers Day</a>.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll be ready to volunteer to give a presentation at your workplace or community event.

However, you\u2019re lying awake at night wondering if you\u2019re missing something\u2014because you know you\u2019re not the end user. You yearn for actionable feedback.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I\u2019ll distill my background in usability research into a how-to framework for taking your site and conducting your first unmoderated usability test. I\u2019ll cover why and when you should be running usability tests; how to set research goals and draft a script for them; setting up your lab environment and capturing feedback; and best practices for facilitation, minimizing bias, keeping users on task and gleaning the most from each brief test.</p>\n<p>Attendees will walk away with enough information to discuss the value of usability testing with decision-makers, as well as a tactical foundation for organizing and running their own usability study.</p>\n"
